This is a progressive project. I plan to start from the basics of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and DataBases. I want to incrementally build and update using modern tech stacks.
Right now the plan is to move to the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). This project is for my wonderful beautiful wife and her balloon business. But I plan to 
use this for other things. My goal is to try and keep it as generic as I can. The MAIN goal is to actually finish something useful for someone I love.

        <p> A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a
            <ul>
                <li> This is item one </li>
                <li> Item two but no order</li>
            </ul>
